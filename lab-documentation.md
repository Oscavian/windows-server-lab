# Motivations behind decisions

I to sticked to the minmum of 3 Windows Server VMs plus one Client VM. So I had to make a few tradeoffs regarding the seperation of services on different machines. My thought-process was the following:

- The Domain Controller has to be a seperate machine, first machine
- SharePoint and MSSQL would probably lead a bottleneck if run on one machine, so seperate them, makes machine two and three.
- The other network services (DNS1, DHCP) and the Root CA also run on the Domain Controller except for the secondary DNS, which obviously has to run on another machine, I chose the Database Machine.
- For the resources, I doubles the minimum of 32G disk size for the server machines to 64G to be sure to have enough space. The machines with a GUI get 128G. Same for the RAM, 1G for WS Core machines, 2G for client and dc.

# Problems

- As my host system is an Arch Linux derivate, I had to install the package `virtualbox-unattended-templates-7.0.10-1` from the AUR.
- I had to install PowerShell on my Linux host in order to write and test the provisioning scripts. Initially, I wrote them in Bash. Retrospectively, I should've started with PowerShell right away, it's not too big of a difference in that case.
- The shared folder wouldn't show up for any reason after the initial boot, only after rebooting once. Don't know why that does not work right away.

## Sharepoint

At first I wanted to configure Sharepoint using the `psconfig.exe` utility instead of using the UI Version. I experimented with the utility but the built in help is so bad and there is hardly any good documentation for it available. This was my best shot:
```ps1
Start-Process -FilePath 'C:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\Web Server Extensions\16\BIN\psconfig.exe' `
    -ArgumentList `
    '-cmd configdb -create -server "SRV003" -database "Sharepoint_Config" -dbuser "WS2-2324-oskar\oskar" -dbpassword "123456" -user "WS2-2324-oskar\oskar" -password "123456" -passphrase "Password123!" -localserverrole "Single-Server Farm"', `
    '-cmd helpcollections', `
    '-cmd secureresources', `
    '-cmd services', `
    '-cmd installfeatures', `
    '-cmd adminvs -provision', `
    '-cmd ssl', `
    '-cmd applicationcontent -install', `
    '-cmd upgrade' `
    -Wait
    -NoNewWindow
```
In the end, I just left with `psconfigui.exe` and let the GUI Magic do its thing.

Additionally, I increased the RAM to 4GiB, because the first installation failed and threw an error due to lack of memory.

# Status

**Before 1st Deadline**

- I created the VM setup as a table and a network diagram depicting my planned setup.
- Apart from that I started creating the automation scripts, because I try to skip the manual install process. 
- I created the first version of the lab documentation

**Before 2nd Deadline**

- I created scripts for creating the NatNetwork and provisioning all 4 machines using VBoxManage.
- Additionally, I started on configuring networking on the machines.
- On the Domain Controller, I installed an Active Directory Forest.
- updated the lab documentation
- wrote the first deployment manual

**Before 3rd Deadline**

- [x] Setup Active directory & DNS on DC
- [x] Join hosts to active directory
- [x] Configure DHCP Server
- [x] Install & configure SQL Server
  - [x] Install & Test SSMS
- [ ] Install & Configure Sharepoint
  - [ ] Establish Connection to SQL Server
  - [ ] Configure Sharepoint Server
  - [ ] Establish connection from client
- [ ] Install Root CA
  - [ ] Generate SSL Cert for intranet site (sharepoint)
- [ ] Improve network diagram
  - [ ] Clarify internet connection (NAT Network)
